# `pretraining-advantage`
Data on the effect of synthetic instance segmentation pretraining on real data for the Vesuvius challenge.

Pretrained weights (on synthetic data) are included in this repository and are stored with git LFS. These include all pretrained checkpoints and the best finetuned checkpoints.

For more information, please see the `pretraining-advantage.ipynb` jupyter notebook, which details the effectiveness of pretraining on synthetic data before training on real scroll data.
